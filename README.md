### Introduction

YAMD is a data serialization standard with Markdown-*like* syntax.

Proper documentation for primary data collection can be hard, especially if it
involves qualatative sources.
Unless working on a project with specialized tools available, researchers
may find themselve starting with two tools: a spreadsheet application (like Excel) 
and a word processor (like Word).
They consult some sources, decide to update the dataset in accordance to the proposal,
made change to the spreadsheet, document said changes in the word file, and so on.

With YAMD, researchers can first focus on documentation, and generate the dataset 
*after* the collection process is complete with available parsers
